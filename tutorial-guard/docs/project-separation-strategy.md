# Project Separation Strategy

> **CONFIDENTIAL**: Strategic planning document for extracting Tutorial Guard and Spack-Go from AWS Research Wizard

## üéØ Strategic Overview

Tutorial Guard and Spack-Go have grown beyond their original scope as AWS Research Wizard sub-projects. Both have significant standalone commercial potential and should be extracted into independent projects with proper licensing and business models.

## üöÄ Separation Timeline & Strategy

### **Phase 1: Internal Validation (Months 1-2)**
**Objective**: Prove market viability and technical feasibility

#### Tutorial Guard:
- [ ] Complete MVP implementation with AI integration
- [ ] Self-test all documentation (dogfooding)
- [ ] Test with Spack-Go documentation
- [ ] Test with AWS Research Wizard documentation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking and optimization
- [ ] Security audit for proprietary components

#### Spack-Go:
- [ ] Finalize standalone library architecture
- [ ] Complete TUI implementation
- [ ] Performance optimization (95% faster claims)
- [ ] Cross-platform testing and validation
- [ ] API stabilization for external use

#### Success Criteria:
- Tutorial Guard achieves 95%+ accuracy on test suite
- Spack-Go demonstrates measurable performance improvements
- Both projects have complete, validated documentation
- Business model validation with potential customers

### **Phase 2: Business Development (Months 2-4)**
**Objective**: Establish commercial viability and partnerships

#### Market Validation:
- [ ] **Publisher Outreach**: Contact 5 technical publishers for pilot programs
- [ ] **Developer Tool Integration**: Explore partnerships with documentation platforms
- [ ] **Enterprise Prospects**: Identify enterprise customers for pilot programs
- [ ] **Competitive Analysis**: Deep dive on potential competitors and differentiation

#### Legal & Business Structure:
- [ ] **Entity Formation**: Decide on business structure (LLC, Corp, Partnership)
- [ ] **Intellectual Property**: File provisional patents for AI tutorial following
- [ ] **Licensing Strategy**: Define tiered licensing model
- [ ] **Partnership Agreements**: Framework for publisher/platform partnerships

#### Success Criteria:
- 3+ publishers express interest in pilot programs
- 1+ enterprise customer commits to paid pilot
- Clear differentiation from existing solutions
- Legal structure and IP protection in place

### **Phase 3: Repository Separation (Months 3-5)**
**Objective**: Create independent projects with proper licensing

#### Repository Strategy:
```yaml
target_structure:
  tutorial-guard:
    repo: "https://github.com/tutorial-guard/tutorial-guard"
    visibility: "private" # Initially private for commercial development
    license: "Proprietary" # Custom commercial license

  spack-go:
    repo: "https://github.com/spack-go/spack-manager"
    visibility: "public" # Open source to build community
    license: "Apache-2.0" # Permissive for library adoption

  aws-research-wizard:
    repo: "https://github.com/aws-research-wizard/aws-research-wizard"
    visibility: "private" # Remains private, uses other projects as dependencies
    license: "Proprietary"
```

#### Migration Process:
1. **Create New Repositories**: Set up independent GitHub organizations
2. **History Preservation**: Use `git subtree` or `git filter-branch` to preserve commit history
3. **Dependency Updates**: Update AWS Research Wizard to use external dependencies
4. **CI/CD Setup**: Independent build and deployment pipelines
5. **Documentation Migration**: Move docs to new repositories
6. **Team Access**: Set up appropriate access controls

#### Tutorial Guard Specific:
```bash
# Migration commands (example)
git subtree push --prefix=tutorial-guard tutorial-guard-origin main
git remote add tutorial-guard-origin https://github.com/tutorial-guard/tutorial-guard
```

### **Phase 4: Public Strategy (Months 5-8)**
**Objective**: Execute go-to-market strategy

#### Tutorial Guard Commercial Launch:
- [ ] **Freemium Model**: Open source core + commercial features
- [ ] **Publisher Partnerships**: Launch pilot programs
- [ ] **Marketing Website**: Professional site with case studies
- [ ] **Developer Outreach**: Conference presentations, blog content

#### Spack-Go Community Building:
- [ ] **Open Source Release**: Public GitHub repository
- [ ] **Package Manager Integration**: Submit to major package managers
- [ ] **Documentation Site**: Comprehensive developer documentation
- [ ] **Community Building**: Discord, discussions, contributor guidelines

## üíº Business Model Considerations

### **Tutorial Guard** (Commercial Focus)
```yaml
licensing_strategy:
  core_engine: "Proprietary" # AI-powered tutorial following
  basic_extractor: "Open Source" # Community adoption driver
  enterprise_features: "Commercial License" # Advanced reporting, integrations

revenue_model:
  freemium: "Limited usage for open source projects"
  professional: "$49/month for teams"
  publisher: "$199/month for book publishers"
  enterprise: "Custom pricing for large organizations"

competitive_moat:
  - "AI-first architecture"
  - "Publisher partnerships"
  - "Quality certification program"
  - "First-mover advantage"
```

### **Spack-Go** (Community + Commercial)
```yaml
licensing_strategy:
  library: "Apache-2.0" # Maximum adoption
  cli_tool: "Apache-2.0" # Developer-friendly
  enterprise_support: "Commercial" # Professional services

revenue_model:
  open_source: "Free library and CLI"
  enterprise_support: "Professional services and training"
  cloud_hosted: "Managed Spack service (future)"

community_building:
  - "GitHub stars and contributions"
  - "Package manager adoption"
  - "Conference presentations"
  - "Documentation and tutorials"
```

## üîê Intellectual Property Strategy

### **Patent Considerations**
- **Tutorial Guard**: File provisional patent for "AI-Powered Documentation Validation"
- **Method Claims**: Natural language instruction parsing for technical documentation
- **System Claims**: Multi-model AI routing for documentation testing
- **Business Method**: Automated certification system for tutorial quality

### **Trade Secrets**
- **AI Training Data**: Curated tutorial understanding datasets
- **Optimization Algorithms**: LLM efficiency and caching strategies
- **Quality Benchmarks**: Provider certification test suites
- **Customer Insights**: Publisher and enterprise integration patterns

### **Trademark Strategy**
- **Tutorial Guard**: Register trademark for commercial protection
- **Spack-Go**: Community-friendly naming, avoid trademark conflicts
- **Certification Program**: "Tutorial Guard Certified" badge program

## üéØ Risk Mitigation

### **Technical Risks**
- **AI Dependency**: Multiple provider support reduces single-point-of-failure
- **Performance**: Extensive benchmarking and optimization before separation
- **Compatibility**: Comprehensive testing across platforms and environments

### **Business Risks**
- **Competition**: First-mover advantage and patent protection
- **Market Adoption**: Pilot programs and customer validation before full launch
- **Revenue Model**: Multiple revenue streams and pricing tiers

### **Legal Risks**
- **IP Ownership**: Clear assignment of intellectual property rights
- **Open Source Compliance**: Careful license management for dependencies
- **Commercial Licensing**: Professional legal review of licensing terms
