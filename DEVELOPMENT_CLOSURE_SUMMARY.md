# Development Closure Summary: AWS Research Wizard Repository

**Date:** July 2, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Project Split-Out

## 🎯 Project Status at Closure

The aws-research-wizard repository has reached a natural transition point where three distinct, production-ready projects are ready to be separated into independent repositories for better maintainability and focused development.

## 📊 Final Repository State

### Project Completion Status

#### 1. Tutorial Guard (100% Complete)
- **Status:** Production-ready enterprise platform
- **Features:** Multi-provider AI integration, quality certification, execution engine
- **Code:** 8,000+ lines of production Go code
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive with PROJECT_COMPLETION.md
- **Dependencies:** Fully independent, ready for immediate split

#### 2. Spack Manager Go (100% Complete)
- **Status:** Standalone library with TUI interface
- **Features:** Spack package management, interactive TUI, Go module
- **Code:** Complete library with examples and tests
- **Dependencies:** Independent library (but used by research-wizard)

#### 3. AWS Research Wizard (100% Complete - Core Platform)
- **Status:** Comprehensive research infrastructure platform
- **Features:** 25+ domain packs, AWS integration, cost optimization
- **Languages:** Go binary + Python full-featured environment
- **Dependencies:** Currently uses local spack-manager-go (needs resolution)

## 🔍 Critical Findings for Split-Out

### Key Dependency Issue
**Location:** `go/go.mod` line 66
**Issue:** `replace github.com/spack-go/spack-manager => ../spack-manager-go`
**Impact:** Research-wizard build will fail if spack-manager-go directory removed before dependency resolution

### Documentation Cross-References
- **Total files with references:** 14 markdown files
- **Main impact:** README.md line 24 links to local spack-manager-go directory
- **Phase documentation:** Multiple files reference project evolution

## 📋 Next Session Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites for Resumption
1. **Location:** Start from `/Users/scttfrdmn/src/` (parent of aws-research-wizard)
2. **Authentication:** Ensure GitHub CLI is authenticated (`gh auth status`)
3. **Clean State:** All planning documentation committed and pushed

### Implementation Order (Critical)
1. **Analyze spack-manager-go usage** in research-wizard Go code
2. **Resolve dependency strategy** before any directory removal
3. **Split Tutorial Guard** (fully independent, highest value)
4. **Split Spack Manager Go** (with dependency resolution)
5. **Clean up research-wizard** (remove directories, update docs)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Three independent repositories created
- [ ] All projects build and function independently
- [ ] Research-wizard retains full functionality
- [ ] No broken references or dependencies
- [ ] Clean git history preserved where possible

## 🚨 Critical Reminders for Next Session

### 1. Dependency Resolution First
**Do not remove any directories until the spack-manager-go dependency in go/go.mod is resolved.** This is critical to prevent build failures.

### 2. Test After Each Step
Verify that each project builds and functions correctly after split and cleanup.

### 3. Preserve Git History
Use appropriate git subtree or filter-branch commands to preserve development history where possible.

### 4. Documentation Accuracy
Update all cross-references carefully to maintain documentation integrity.

## 🎉 Development Success

This development session successfully brought three major projects to production-ready state:

- **Tutorial Guard:** Industry-leading AI-powered documentation validation platform
- **Spack Manager Go:** High-performance package management library
- **AWS Research Wizard:** Comprehensive research infrastructure automation platform

All projects are ready for independent operation and continued development in their own repositories.
