# Real AWS Deployment Issues Log

## Testing Status: **IN PROGRESS**
**Started:** January 3, 2025
**Current Phase:** Initial deployment testing and issue identification

---

## üéØ Testing Summary

### **AWS Profile Validation: ‚úÖ PASSED**
- AWS CLI configured with 'aws' profile
- IAM user: `scofri` in account `942542972736`
- Permissions: `AdministratorAccess` (sufficient for all operations)
- Connectivity: Confirmed working

### **Deployment Attempt #1: ‚ùå FAILED**
**Domain:** Digital Humanities
**Instance:** c6i.2xlarge
**Stack:** test-digital-humanities-20250702-2156
**Issue:** Deployment hangs during CloudFormation stack creation

---

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### **Issue #1: Deployment Hangs (Priority: P0 - Blocker)**
**Symptom:**
- Command: `./aws-research-wizard deploy start --domain digital_humanities --instance c6i.2xlarge --stack test-digital-humanities-20250702-2156`
- Hangs at "‚è≥ Waiting for stack completion"
- Times out after 2 minutes (command timeout)
- No CloudFormation stack actually created in AWS

**Analysis:**
- Deployment appears to start successfully (shows stack ARN)
- CloudFormation stack doesn't exist when checked
- Suggests failure in stack template generation or submission
- May be an issue with the Go deployment implementation

**Potential Causes:**
1. **CloudFormation Template Issues:** Invalid template syntax or resources
2. **AWS API Timeout:** Stack creation taking longer than expected
3. **Permission Issues:** Despite AdministratorAccess, specific operation might fail
4. **Go Implementation Bug:** Error in the deployment code logic
5. **Region/Resource Availability:** c6i.2xlarge not available in us-east-1

**Investigation Needed:**
- [ ] Examine CloudFormation template being generated
- [ ] Check AWS CloudTrail for failed API calls
- [ ] Test with different instance types and regions
- [ ] Add verbose logging to deployment process
- [ ] Test with the legacy shell script deployer

### **Issue #2: Limited Debug Output (Priority: P1 - Critical)**
**Symptom:**
- `--debug` flag doesn't provide sufficient detail
- Cannot see CloudFormation template being generated
- No visibility into AWS API calls being made

**Impact:** Makes troubleshooting deployment failures very difficult

**Resolution Needed:**
- [ ] Add verbose logging to show CloudFormation template
- [ ] Log all AWS API calls and responses
- [ ] Add intermediate status reporting during deployment
- [ ] Implement better error handling and reporting

## üîß Immediate Action Items

### **High Priority (Fix First)**
1. **Debug Deployment Hanging Issue**
   - Add comprehensive logging to deployment process
   - Test with different instance types (t3.micro for testing)
   - Verify CloudFormation template generation
   - Check AWS CloudTrail for error details

2. **Validate CloudFormation Integration**
   - Test basic CloudFormation stack creation manually
   - Verify template syntax and resource definitions
   - Confirm IAM permissions for all required operations

3. **Test Alternative Deployment Methods**
   - Try the bash script deployer (`deploy-research-solution.sh`)
   - Test deployment with minimal configuration
   - Validate EC2 instance creation independently

### **Medium Priority (After Basic Deployment Works)**
1. **Implement Version Override Functionality**
   - Add config export command: `./aws-research-wizard config export [domain]`
   - Allow custom config file deployment
   - Test version override capabilities

2. **Enhance Error Reporting**
   - Add structured error logging
   - Implement deployment progress tracking
   - Create user-friendly error messages

## üîÑ Next Steps

### **Immediate (Next Session)**
1. **Investigate deployment hanging issue**
   - Examine Go deployment code implementation
   - Add debug logging to see where it fails
   - Test with minimal EC2 instance creation

2. **Test alternative deployment approaches**
   - Try bash script deployment method
   - Test manual CloudFormation stack creation
   - Validate individual AWS API operations

3. **Establish working deployment baseline**
   - Get at least one domain deploying successfully
   - Document the working deployment process
   - Create template for systematic domain testing

### **Short Term (This Week)**
1. **Systematic domain testing** once basic deployment works
2. **Implement version override functionality**
3. **Create comprehensive error tracking system**
4. **Document all findings and fixes**

### **Medium Term (Next Week)**
1. **Complete all 27 domain deployments**
2. **Performance and cost validation**
3. **Production readiness assessment**

## üí° Lessons Learned

### **Key Insights**
1. **CLI validation ‚â† Real deployment testing** - Previous testing was insufficient
2. **AWS integration complexity** - More debugging infrastructure needed
3. **Deployment process needs improvement** - Better error handling required

### **Process Improvements**
1. **Always test with real AWS first** before claiming "deployment ready"
2. **Implement comprehensive logging** for complex AWS operations
3. **Start with simplest possible deployment** and build complexity gradually

---

## üìù Testing Protocol Updates

### **Revised Testing Approach**
1. **Fix deployment blocking issues first** before testing all domains
2. **Start with minimal test deployments** (t3.micro instances)
3. **Validate each component independently** before integration testing
4. **Use multiple deployment methods** (Go CLI, bash scripts, manual)

### **Success Criteria (Revised)**
- **Minimum:** One domain deploys successfully end-to-end
- **Target:** 5+ domains deploy reliably with error handling
- **Goal:** All 27 domains deploy with systematic error resolution
