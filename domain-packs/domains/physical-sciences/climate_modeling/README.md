# Climate & Atmospheric Modeling Laboratory

High-performance climate models and analysis tools

## Target Users
Climate researchers, atmospheric scientists, earth system modelers

## Primary Domains
Climate Science, Atmospheric Physics, Oceanography, Earth System Science

## Deployment Variants
analyst: Data analysis and visualization tools only, regional: WRF + mesoscale modeling tools, global: CESM + global climate models, ocean: Ocean modeling and analysis, comprehensive: All models + full analysis suite

## Sample Workflows
- Regional climate downscaling with WRF (1-10 km resolution)
- Global climate projections with CESM
- Hurricane/typhoon intensity modeling
- Air quality and atmospheric chemistry modeling
- Ocean circulation and sea level analysis
- Climate impact assessment workflows
- Ensemble climate projection analysis
- Extreme weather event detection and attribution

## Immediate Value
- Pre-compiled climate models ready for AWS Graviton3
- 50% faster model compilation with AWS Spack cache
- Optimized for AWS Parallel Cluster deployment
- Example model configurations included
- Performance tuning for AWS EC2 HPC instances

## Cost Profile
- idle: $0/day (models cached, no compute)
- data_analysis: $8-25/day (post-processing, visualization)
- regional_runs: $50-200/day (WRF simulations)
- global_modeling: $200-800/day (CESM century runs)
- ensemble_runs: $500-2000/day (multiple scenarios)
- storage: $2.30/month per 100GB model output
- monthly_estimate: $500-3000/month for climate modeling group

## Getting Started

1. Deploy the environment:
   ```bash
   ./aws-research-wizard deploy --domain climate_&_atmospheric_modeling_laboratory
   ```

2. Activate the Spack environment:
   ```bash
   spack env activate climate_&_atmospheric_modeling_laboratory
   ```

3. Install packages:
   ```bash
   spack install
   ```
