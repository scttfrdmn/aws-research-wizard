# Genomics & Bioinformatics Laboratory

Complete genomics analysis with optimized bioinformatics tools

## Target Users
Genomics researchers, bioinformaticians, molecular biologists (1-10 users)

## Primary Domains
Genomics, Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, Evolutionary Biology

## Deployment Variants
minimal: Core alignment and variant calling tools, rna_seq: Specialized for transcriptomics analysis, assembly: Focus on genome/metagenome assembly, population: Large-scale population genomics, comprehensive: Full genomics toolkit

## Sample Workflows
- Whole genome sequencing variant calling (GATK4 best practices)
- RNA-seq differential expression analysis (STAR + DESeq2)
- Long-read genome assembly (Canu + Flye)
- Single-cell RNA-seq analysis workflow
- Metagenomics classification and assembly
- ChIP-seq peak calling and motif analysis
- Population genomics and GWAS analysis
- Phylogenomic reconstruction pipeline

## Immediate Value
- Launch genomics analysis in 2 minutes with AWS-cached binaries
- 30-40% performance improvement with Graviton3 optimization
- All dependencies pre-resolved and optimized
- Reference genomes and databases pre-configured
- Example workflows with real datasets included

## Cost Profile
- idle: $0/day (Spack environment cached)
- light_analysis: $5-15/day (small datasets, basic alignment)
- standard_genomics: $15-45/day (WGS analysis, RNA-seq)
- large_cohort: $45-120/day (population studies)
- storage: $2.30/month per 100GB
- monthly_estimate: $150-900/month for active genomics lab

## Getting Started

1. Deploy the environment:
   ```bash
   ./aws-research-wizard deploy --domain genomics_&_bioinformatics_laboratory
   ```

2. Activate the Spack environment:
   ```bash
   spack env activate genomics_&_bioinformatics_laboratory
   ```

3. Install packages:
   ```bash
   spack install
   ```

## AWS Optimization
