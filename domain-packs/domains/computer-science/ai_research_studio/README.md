# AI/ML Research Studio

GPU-optimized machine learning and AI development environment

## Target Users
ML researchers, AI engineers, data scientists, computer science labs

## Primary Domains
Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing

## Deployment Variants
cpu: CPU-only for prototyping and inference, single_gpu: Single GPU workstation for research, multi_gpu: Multi-GPU for large model training, distributed: Multi-node distributed training, edge: Optimized for model deployment and serving

## Sample Workflows
- Large language model fine-tuning (BERT, GPT, T5)
- Computer vision model training (ResNet, YOLO, ViT)
- Distributed training with multiple GPUs/nodes
- Hyperparameter optimization with Ray Tune
- MLOps pipeline with automated deployment
- Reinforcement learning environments
- Time series forecasting with transformers
- Federated learning across institutions

## Immediate Value
- GPU-optimized frameworks with CUDA 12.2 support
- Pre-trained models and datasets cached locally
- Distributed training ready out-of-the-box
- MLOps tools for experiment tracking
- Performance benchmarks on AWS GPU instances

## Cost Profile
- idle: $0/day (frameworks cached, no GPU usage)
- cpu_development: $5-20/day (prototyping, data prep)
- single_gpu: $30-120/day (model training V100/A100)
- multi_gpu: $120-500/day (large model training)
- distributed: $500-2000/day (cluster training 8+ nodes)
- inference: $0.02-1.00 per 1000 predictions
- monthly_estimate: $300-2500/month for ML research team
